# 🌍 IncuNest — Open-Source Neonatal Incubator

**IncuNest** (from *in3ator*) is an open-source neonatal incubator designed for hospitals with limited resources.  
Its mission is to reduce neonatal mortality worldwide by providing an accessible, reliable, and locally replicable medical device.

---

## 🩺 Background and Motivation

Every year, over **1.5 million premature babies** die because they don’t have access to an incubator.  
Commercial incubators can cost more than **€35,000**, making them unaffordable in many low-income regions.

**IncuNest** was created as a **low-cost (≈ €350 in components)**, **energy-efficient** alternative, capable of maintaining a newborn’s temperature and humidity even in environments with unstable electricity.  
It can be built locally with standard tools and commonly available materials.

The project is developed and maintained by the NGO [**Medical Open World**](https://medicalopenworld.org/, recipient of the **2025 Princess of Girona Social Award**.  
To date, more than **200 incubators have been installed across 30 countries**, saving thousands of newborn lives.

### 🔐 WiFi and ThingsBoard Configuration

To enable WiFi or ThingsBoard functionality, create or edit the file  
`Firmware/motherBoard/include/Credentials.h` and add your configuration as follows:

```cpp
#ifndef CREDENTIALS
#define CREDENTIALS

#define THINGSBOARD_SERVER "your_url_to_thingsboard"
#define THINGSBOARD_PORT 1883

#define FACTORY_SERVER 0
#define DEMO_SERVER 1

#define THINGSBOARD_PROVISION_SERVER FACTORY_SERVER

#if (THINGSBOARD_PROVISION_SERVER == DEMO_SERVER)
    #define PROVISION_DEVICE_KEY "yourProvisionKey"
    #define PROVISION_DEVICE_SECRET "yourProvisionKeySecret"
#elif (THINGSBOARD_PROVISION_SERVER == FACTORY_SERVER)
    #define PROVISION_DEVICE_KEY "yourProvisionKey"
    #define PROVISION_DEVICE_SECRET "yourProvisionKeySecret"
#endif

#define ssid "yourwifissid"
#define wifiPassword "yourwifipassword"

#endif // CREDENTIALS

```

## ⚙️ Setup and Installation

### 🔧 Firmware
1. Install [**PlatformIO**](https://platformio.org/) (recommended inside VSCode).  
2. There are 2 boards to program (the display and the motherboard).
3. Open the `Firmware/XXX` folder.  
4. Connect your board.  
5. Build and upload the firmware:
   ```bash
   pio run --target upload

## 💡 Hardware

All electronic and mechanical designs are available in the `Hardware/` folder,  
including **schematics**, **PCB layouts**, and **3D printable parts**.
